    We strive for highest quality and satisfaction of our customers.

Mizarstvo Å½gajner is a small joinery company, founded in 1995. The business first launched in a small workshop with our own powered machinery.

In 2003 we moved into a new and larger workshop which was updated with new machinery in 2010. We managed to obtain high quality, due to which we have been successfully present in the joinery market for over 20 years.
